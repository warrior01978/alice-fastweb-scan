Provide Android fast and usable UI, for testing security of your Alice and Fastweb WiFi network.
Test for preset wpa keys of Pirelli routers.
This work is based on WhiteHat Crew research on Alice and Fastweb routers.

DISCLAIMER
It's illegal test security of not your own network. So if you plan to do it, don't blame me if you are going in jail.

---

Known problems:
All network disapper form list when changing orientation of device.
Context menu doesn't work (it's just for debug right now)
Connetion is allowd only on (Alice networks and Fastweb networks). Other networks that are noe in form of Alice-xxxxxxxx and FASTWEB-1-xxxxxxxxxx are not accepted.
Todo list:
-Connect on open networks
-View only option for network (view found keys without testing it)

Please send me your feedback with bugs and improvments.

Note: This is my first project so, please don't be rude :)
